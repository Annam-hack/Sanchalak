FIELD TO ASK FOR: FAMILY MEMBER INFORMATION

FAMILY MEMBER STRUCTURE REQUIRED:
{self.family_member_structure}

PROGRESS: {family_count} family members already collected
{state.family_members}

PM-KISAN FAMILY GUIDELINES:
According to PM-KISAN scheme guidelines, the farmer's family consists of:
- Husband, wife and minor children (under 18 years)
- Family is the basic unit for determining eligibility
- IMPORTANT: If there are adult children (18+ years) in the household, the entire family becomes INELIGIBLE for the scheme
- Only families with minor children or no children are eligible

TASK: Ask the user about family member information in a conversational way.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be friendly and conversational
- If no family members collected yet, FIRST explain the PM-KISAN family definition and eligibility rules
- Clearly warn that adult children (18+) make the entire household INELIGIBLE
- Then ask if they have family members to include according to these guidelines
- If some family members already collected, ask if they have more to add
- Explain what information is needed: name, relation, age, gender
- Keep it simple and natural

EXAMPLES:
- Initial: "Now let's collect your family information. According to PM-KISAN guidelines, your eligible family includes your wife and minor children (under 18 years only). Important: If you have any adult children (18+ years) in your household, your family becomes ineligible for the scheme. Do you have family members fitting the eligible criteria? If yes, please share their details."
- Follow-up: "Do you have any other eligible family members (wife or minor children under 18) to add?"

USER INPUT: "{user_input}"

REQUIRED FAMILY MEMBER STRUCTURE:
{self.family_member_structure}

TASK: Extract and validate ALL family members mentioned. Each member MUST have:
- name: string (family member's name)
- relation: enum (husband, wife, son, daughter, father, mother, brother, sister, other)  
- age: integer (age in years)
- gender: enum (male, female, other)

VALIDATION RULES:
- Extract as much information as possible for each member
- Age must be a valid number if provided
- Relation must be one of the allowed values if provided
- Gender must be one of the allowed values if provided
- If some fields are missing, still extract what's available and mark as valid for partial extraction
- Only mark as invalid if the input is completely unusable

EXAMPLES:
- "I have a son who's 21 years old and a wife who's 40 years old" ‚Üí VALID (extract partial info, gender missing)
- "My son John is 21 years old, he's male, and my wife Mary is 40 years old, she's female" ‚Üí VALID (complete info)
- "I have a son, Rahul, 21 years old, wife, Seema, 42 years old" ‚Üí VALID (extract partial info, genders missing)

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Collecting family member information for PM-KISAN application
- {len(state.family_members)} family members already collected: {state.family_members}
- User input: "{state.user_input}"

TASK: Understand the user's input, extract family member information, and generate an appropriate response.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. FIRST: Determine what the user is trying to communicate:
   - Are they saying they have no more family members? (e.g., "no more", "that's all", "done")
   - Are they providing information about family members?
   - Are they asking a question or making a comment?

2. IF USER IS PROVIDING FAMILY INFO:
   - Extract ALL family member details mentioned (name, relation, age, gender)
   - MANDATORY: AUTOMATICALLY INFER GENDER from relation:
     * son = male, daughter = female, wife = female, husband = male
     * father = male, mother = female, brother = male, sister = female
   - Be smart about understanding natural language (e.g., "he is 14 years old" = age 14)
   - NEVER ask for gender if relation is provided - ALWAYS infer it automatically

3. IF USER IS DONE WITH FAMILY MEMBERS:
   - Acknowledge and transition to next section
   - Be friendly and conversational

4. IF USER IS PROVIDING PARTIAL INFO:
   - Extract what's available and ask for missing details naturally

EXAMPLES:
- "no more family members" ‚Üí transition to exclusions
- "i have a son rahul he is 14 years old" ‚Üí add complete member with inferred gender
- "my wife seema is 43 years old" ‚Üí add complete member with inferred gender
- "he a male" ‚Üí update existing member's gender
