- Husband, wife and minor children (under 18 years)
- Family is the basic unit for determining eligibility
- IMPORTANT: If there are adult children (18+ years) in the household, the entire family becomes INELIGIBLE for the scheme

TASK: Ask the user about family member information in a conversational way.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be friendly and conversational
- If no family members collected yet, FIRST explain the PM-KISAN family definition and eligibility rules
- Clearly warn that adult children (18+) make the entire household INELIGIBLE
- Then ask if they have family members to include according to these guidelines
- If some family members already collected, ask if they have more to add
- Explain what information is needed: name, relation, age, gender
- Keep it simple and natural

EXAMPLES:

Important: If you have any adult children (18+ years) in your household, your family becomes ineligible for the scheme. Do you have family members fitting the eligible criteria?

USER INPUT: "{user_input}"

REQUIRED FAMILY MEMBER STRUCTURE:
{self.family_member_structure}

TASK: Extract and validate ALL family members mentioned. Each member MUST have:
- name: string (family member's name)
- relation: enum (husband, wife, son, daughter, father, mother, brother, sister, other)  
- age: integer (age in years)
- gender: enum (male, female, other)

VALIDATION RULES:
- Extract as much information as possible for each member
- Age must be a valid number if provided
- Relation must be one of the allowed values if provided
- Gender must be one of the allowed values if provided
- If some fields are missing, still extract what's available and mark as valid for partial extraction
- Only mark as invalid if the input is completely unusable

EXAMPLES:
- "I have a son who's 21 years old and a wife who's 40 years old" ‚Üí VALID (extract partial info, gender missing)
- "My son John is 21 years old, he's male, and my wife Mary is 40 years old, she's female" ‚Üí VALID (complete info)
- "I have a son, Rahul, 21 years old, wife, Seema, 42 years old" ‚Üí VALID (extract partial info, genders missing)

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{{
    "is_valid": true/false,
    "extracted_members": [
        {{"name": "John", "relation": "son", "age": 21, "gender": "male"}},
