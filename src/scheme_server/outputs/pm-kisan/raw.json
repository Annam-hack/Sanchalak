In\nsuch States an alternate implementation mechanism for eligibility of the farmers will be\ndeveloped and approved by the Committee of Union Ministers of Ministry of\nDevelopment of North East Region (DoNER), the Ministry of Rural Development\n(Department of Land Resources), the Union Agriculture Minister and the concerned\nState Chief Ministers or their Ministerial representatives, based on the proposal by the\nconcerned North Eastern States.\n5.5.1 For identification of bona fide beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Manipur, the\nfollowing proposal of Government of Manipur was considered and approved by the\nCommittee:\n“The certificate issued by the Village authority, namely, the Chairman/Chief, authorizing\nany tribal family to cultivate a piece of land, may be accepted. Such certification of\nvillage Chairman/Chief shall be authenticated by the concerned sub-divisional officers.\nAll the exclusions under the Operational Guidelines will be applicable.”\n5.5.2 For identification of bona fide beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Nagaland,\nthe following procedure was approved by the Committee:\n1) In case of community owned cultivable land in the state of Nagaland which is\nunder permanent cultivation, for identification of beneficiaries under PM-KISAN,\nthe certificate issued by the village council/authority/village chieftan regarding\nland holding, duly verified by the administrative head of the circle/sub-division\nand countersigned by the Deputy Commissioner of the District shall suffice\nsubject to the exclusions under the operational guidelines.\n2) In case of cultivable land in the State of Nagaland which is categorised as Jhum\nland as per definition under Section–2(7) of the Nagaland Jhum Land Act, 1970\nand which is owned by the community/clan/village council/village chieftan, the\nidentification of beneficiaries under PM-Kisan scheme, shall be on the basis of\ncertification of land holding by the village council/chief/head of the village, duly\nverified by the administrative head of the circle/sub division and countersigned by\nthe Deputy Commissioner of the District.

Farmers’ names, subject to the exclusion criterion after\nfollowing the aforementioned process, shall be uploaded on the PM-Kisan portal along\nwith other required details for this disbursement of benefit under the scheme.”\n6. Strategy for Implementation\n6.1 The States shall prepare database of eligible beneficiary land holder farmer\nfamilies in the villages capturing the Name, Age, Gender, Category (SC/ST), Aadhaar\nNumber, Bank Account Number and the Mobile Number of the beneficiaries.\nResponsibility of identifying the land holder farmer family eligible for benefit under the\nscheme shall be of the State / UT Government. In case of beneficiaries in States of\nAssam, Meghalaya, J&K where Aadhaar number has not been issued to most of the\ncitizens, Aadhaar number shall be collected for those beneficiaries where it is available\nand for others alternate prescribed documents such as Driving Licence, Voters’ ID Card,\nNREGA Job Card, or any other identification documents issued by Central / State / UT\nGovernments or their authorities, etc. can be collected for identity verification purposes.\nThese three States have been exempted from the requirement of Aadhaar number till\n31.3.2021. In the meantime these States will complete Aadhaar enrolment. States / UTs\nshall ensure that there is no duplication of the payment transferred to eligible families.\nSpeedy reconciliation in case of wrong / incomplete bank details of the beneficiary\nshould be ensured.\n6.2 For the purpose of exclusion States have to take a self-declaration from the\nbeneficiaries as detailed in par 4.2 above. In the said self-declaration taken by the\nStates / UT Governments an undertaking should also be included wherein the consent\nof the beneficiaries should be taken for using the Aadhaar number for verification of his\neligibility for the scheme with the concerned agencies. This consent of the beneficiary\nshould be “to agree that the department responsible for implementation of the Pradhan\nMantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana in Union Government or the State Government /\nUnion Territory Administration can use the beneficiary Aadhaar number and other\ninformation provided in the declaration to verify the eligibility of the beneficiary for\nscheme as per extant scheme guidelines with the concerned agencies”.\n6.3 The existing land-ownership system in the concerned State / UT will be used for\nidentification of beneficiaries. Accordingly, it is of utmost importance that the land\nrecords are clear and updated. Further, State / UT Governments would also expedite\n6the progress of digitization of the land records and linking the same with Aadhaar as\nwell as bank details of the beneficiaries.\n6.4 The lists of eligible beneficiaries would be published at the village level. Farmers’\nfamilies who are eligible but have been excluded should be provided an opportunity to\nrepresent their case.\n7. Review, Monitoring and Grievance Redressal Mechanism\n7.1 There will be stratified review / monitoring mechanism at National, State and\nDistrict Level. At the National level, the Review Committee will be headed by Cabinet\nSecretary. The States shall notify the State and District Level Review / Monitoring\nCommittee.\n7.2 The States shall also notify State and District Level Grievance Redressal\nMonitoring Committees for looking into all the grievances related to implementation of\nthe scheme. Any grievances or complaints which are received should be disposed off\non merit preferably within two weeks time.\n8. Setting up of Project Monitoring Unit (PMU)\n8.1 A Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) at Central level will be set up in the Department\nof Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) in the form of a Society\nregistered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. This PMU shall be tasked with\nthe responsibility of overall monitoring of the scheme and shall be headed by Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO). PMU shall also undertake publicity campaign (Information,\nEducation and Communication-IEC).\n8.2 Each State / UT Government will designate a Nodal Department for\nimplementation of the scheme and coordinating with Central Government with regard to\nimplementation of Income Support Scheme.\n8.3 On the lines of PMU at central level, States / UTs may consider setting up\ndedicated Project Monitoring Units at State / UT Level. 0.125% for the amount of\ninstallments transferred to beneficiaries can be transferred by Central Government to\nState / UT Government to cover the expenditure on their PMUs, if established and for\nmeeting other related administrative expenses including cost to be incurred for\nprocurement of stationary, field verification, filling of prescribed formats, their\ncertification and its uploading as well as incentive for field functionaries, publicity, etc.\nStates / UTs will furnish the details of the account to which Administrative Charges are\ncredited by the Central Government. The administrative charges payable to the States /\nUTs will be provided by Government of India based on the volume of work and the\nnumber of beneficiaries.\n79. PM-Kisan Portal for implementation of the scheme (Beneficiary Details\nuploading by State)\n9.1 Beneficiaries under the scheme are to be identified by the respective State and\nUnion Territory. The details of farmers are being maintained by the States / UTs either\nin electronic form or in manual register. To make integrated platform available in the\ncountry to assist in benefit transfer, a platform named PM-Kisan Portal available at\nURL (http://pmkisan.gov.in) has been be launched for uploading the farmers’ details\nat a single web-portal in a uniform structure.\n9.2 The PM-Kisan Portal has been created with the following objectives -\ni) To provide verified and single source of truth on farmers’ details at the portal.\nii) Timely assistance to the farmers in farm operation\niii) A unified e-platform for transferring of cash benefits into farmer’s bank account\nthrough Public Financial Management System (PFMS) integration.\niv) Location wise availability of benefited farmers’ list.\nv) Ease of monitoring across the country on fund transaction details.\n9.3 PM-Kisan Portal :\nThe following farmer attributes need to be entered in the Portal:\nFarmer Attributes: (Essential):\nState, District, Sub-District/Block, Village, Farmer Name, Type of Identity –\nAadhaar Number and in case Aadhaar not available, Aadhaar enrollment number\nwith any other ID proof like Voter ID etc, Gender, Category, IFSC Code, Bank\nAccount Number.\nFarmer Attributes (Optional):\nFather name, Address, Mobile Number, Date of Birth/Age, Farm-Size in Hectare,\nSurvey Number, Khasra Number\nOptional attributes such as Mobile number can be utilized for SMS alerts.

However,\nthese attributes are not essential for purpose of transfer of money.\nThese attributes are illustrated on PM-KISAN Portal http://pmkisan.gov.in as\nfollows\n89.4 There are 3 ways through which a State / UT can onboard on the PM Kisan\nPortal:\n(a) If a State / UT has village / district wise list of farmers, they may upload\nthe same in a pre-defined format and with the help of local NIC State Unit.\n(b) Some existing data of farmers is already available on the PM-Kisan Portal\nwhich will be visible on selection of States / Districts / Village. States / UTs\nwhich do not have their own list may use this village-wise list of farmers as\nprovided on the portal and edit the same to finalize the farmers’ list. For\nthis the correction window shall be available at PM-Kisan portal for\nauthorized users of District and Block officials.\n(c) If States / UTs want to make fresh entry of a farmer, provision is there for\nregistration of these farmers in a defined and standardized format.\n9.5 Databases of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Soil Health Cards,\nSocio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) can also be utilized for this purpose.\nState/UT wise status of number of farmer records shall be available at .\nhttp://pmkisan.gov.in\n9.6 Records preparation process through PM-KISAN Portal:\n1. State-admin and District-admin need to be identified for creation of login\ncredentials or approval of login credentials in case of self-registration by\nDistrict and Block / Tehsil / Taluka officials.\n9STATE ADMIN\nDISTRICT ADMIN DISTRICT ADMIN\nDISTRICT ADMIN\nBLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK\nUSER USER USER USER USER USER USER USER USER\n2. Farmers list as available on the portal shall be available at Block / Tehsil /\nTaluka level official’s login.\n3. Search facility will also be available to get details on Farmers by Name,\nAadhaar Number or Mobile Number in case PM-KISAN Portal data is being\nused. Facility to add new farmers’ details shall be available, if details are not\nfound in the list.\n4. The verified list shall be e-signed by the District level or block / tehsil / taluka\nlevel officials as the case may be. The exclusion categories specified in\nscheme guidelines also need to be taken care before e-signing the verified\nfarmers list.\n5. The States Nodal Officer shall submit a district wise e-Signed list of farmers to\nthe Program Division of DAC&FW through PM-Kisan Portal.\n10 Modalities for transfer of benefit\n10.1 The financial benefit of Rs.6000/- per year is to be released to the eligible\nfarmers in three installments of Rs.2000/- each every 4-month / trimester, i.e. April-July,\nAugust-November and December-March.\n10.2 The Scheme is being implemented through an Aadhaar linked electronic data\nbase containing details of all members of the families of the farmers whose names\nappear in the land records.

However, where the states verify that\nAadhaar linked accounts are not the loan accounts of beneficiaries, the Aadhaar linked\npayment system can be adopted. However, from the December, 2019 – March, 2020\ntrimester onwards the States shall have to ensure Aadhaar linked bank accounts of the\nbeneficiaries, except in case of Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu & Kashmir, which have\nbeen given exemption till the 31st March, 2021. For ease of implementation the States\nmay consider assigning the job of sponsoring bank for the scheme to the same bank\nbeing used by concerned State for MGNREGS.\n10.4 The funds pertaining to income support benefit as well as administrative charges\nshall be released from Government of India to the State designated account /\nmechanism. Detailed modalities for transfer of funds are as under:\n(a) The amount due to the beneficiaries under the scheme is to be paid directly into\ntheir bank accounts through the mechanism of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).

States may consider\ndesignating the same bank for use for MNRGES for sponsoring bank for this\nschemes.\nv. The bank to be designated as sponsoring bank is to have well developed IT\nsystem with the capabilities of integration with web portal of the scheme and\nPFMS.\nvi. Details of sponsoring bank along with IFSC code and bank account number in\nwhich funds are to be transferred are to be provided to the Department.\n11vii. States / UT Governments are to authorise the sponsoring bank to directly\ntransmit the amount received under the scheme to destination banks having\nbeneficiary account.\nviii.
